Currently the list of categories as seen in the dropdown is hardcoded in the project. For this task, the list needs to be coming from the database not hardcoded. 
We have an endpoint that returns all categories please peruse the frontend code and inform Gbenga Omowole Samson what you need returned from that endpoint
